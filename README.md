Building Darok.ng with admin panel and an ecommerce front, using tailwind css for the admin panel styling and standard tight components for the ecommerce front styling, this project is going to be built using nextjs, reactjs and mongodb.

Initializing a next project app based on the frameowrk, tools and commands that I used:

/ \*\*\* This steps weren't necessary in the grand
scheme

- npm init -y (to initialize a new npm project with a default package.json file).
- nvm to swtich to the required node version.
- npm install next react react-dom (Command to install nextjs along with its required dependencies: REACT and REACTDOM).
- npx create-next-app@13.2.3 to use a particular version. (creates necceasry files and folders for a basic nextjs app in the current directory).
  \*\*\*\*\

- npm run dev (starts the development server).

Where i stopped cause my laptop is low
reinstall the next js app for admin panel and tune it to be close to the tutorial im watching, what i understood was doing it manually will break the development server.
I ended up using the version that was used in the tutorial by installing the next app using npx create-next-app@13.2.3 and it worked
